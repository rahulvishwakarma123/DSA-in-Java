# Time and Space Complexity

## Time Complexity

Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps in determining the efficiency of an algorithm. The common notations used to express time complexity are:

- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time
- **O(n!)**: Factorial time

## Space Complexity

Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. It includes both the memory needed for the input data and the memory needed for the auxiliary variables. The common notations used to express space complexity are similar to those for time complexity:

- **O(1)**: Constant space
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic space
- **O(n)**: Linear space
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic space
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic space

Understanding both time and space complexity is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing existing ones.
