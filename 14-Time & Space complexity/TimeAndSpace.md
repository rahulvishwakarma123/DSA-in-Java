# Time and Space Complexity

## Time Complexity
Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps in estimating the efficiency of an algorithm. The most common notations used to express time complexity are:

- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time
- **O(n!)**: Factorial time

## Space Complexity
Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. It includes both the memory needed to store the input data and the memory needed for the algorithm to execute. The common notations for space complexity are similar to those for time complexity.

## Importance
Understanding time and space complexity is crucial for designing efficient algorithms that can handle large inputs within reasonable time and memory constraints. It helps in comparing different algorithms and choosing the most appropriate one for a given problem.

## Examples
- **Binary Search**: O(log n) time complexity
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n) time complexity
- **Bubble Sort**: O(n^2) time complexity

By analyzing the time and space complexity, developers can optimize their code and improve the performance of their applications.
