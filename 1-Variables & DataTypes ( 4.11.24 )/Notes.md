## Size of DataTypes :-

        Byte        -       1 btye
        Short       -       2 btye
        Char        -       2 btye
        Boolean     -       1 btye
        int         -       4 btye
        Long        -       8 btye
        Double      -       8 btye
        Float       -       4 btye

## Inputs in Java :-

        next()
        nextLine()
        nextInt()
        nextFloat()
        nextDouble()
        nextLong()
        nextBoolean()
        nextShort()
        nextByte()

## Type Conversion :-
It is called widening conversion.

        byte->short->int->float->long->double

## type Casting :-
It is called Narrowing cconversion.
it is called explicit conversion.

## Type promotion in expresion:-

1. Java actually premote each byte,short or char operand to int when evaluating an expression.
2. If one oprand is long, float or double the whole expression is premoted to long, float or double respectively.
